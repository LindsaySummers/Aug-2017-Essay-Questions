# L i n d s a y S u m m e r s' E s s a y Q u e s t i o n s    
  
## **Question #1: *Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?***  
Honestly, I have always been interested in programming. I remember when AOL first came out (I was 7th grade – middle school). Not only can I remember the noise that it made when it was “dialing” the internet, but I remember AOL profiles – a section where you can type a bit about yourself so that others could learn a bit about you. I remember thinking that plain text was boring, so I researched if there was a way to make it more interesting. Sure enough, I found myself diving deep into HTML: bold, underlined, italicized text, headers, and colors! I was in heaven! I absolutely LOVED making my AOL profile truly reflect my personality. Soon after, MySpace was introduced and I also used a lot of HTML there too.  
  
I consider myself to be a very logical, systematic, and organized person, so I believe that my brain has always been on the same wave-length as one who is a programmer.  
  
When I was in college, I naturally found myself studying math – and I loved it! I found math to be very satisfying because it was very “black and white” – no debates, no grey area, and no subjectivity. Yet, at the same time, I appreciated the other side of mathematics as well – a side that a lot of people don’t even know exists in math (even when I try to explain it to them). There is a beautiful side to mathematics (as well as any type of problem solving), that is extremely artistic. Problems can be approached, and solved, in many different ways and styles; this only deepened my love for mathematics and general problem solving. I loved tackling new problems each day which lead to brainstorming and collaborating with my classmates. I loved how I could solve a problem one way, and then a month later, look at the same problem in a while new light.  
  
Long story short: I earned my Bachelor of ARTS degree (not Bachelor of Science) in Mathematics.  
  
Nowadays, I use MS Excel for just about everything (not for a job, just in my every day life, because I love it). I love that I can use nested conditional statements to organize whatever I’m working with.  
  
What I have done recently to expose myself to programming is that I’ve been practicing on Code.org, Scratch.mit.edu, Jump Start, etc.

## **Question #2: *If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?***   
If I were accepted into Ada’s career-transition-program, then I imagine myself no longer in the teaching field, but completely immersed and loving the programming world. I have a vision of being on an amazing, fun-loving, diverse team, who all love problem-solving, collaborating, and helping each other learn.  
  
I usually have crazy ideas for new apps and always think about how businesses can improve if they just have a program that could (insert crazy idea here), or if they have an app that could (insert radical app idea here). I have yearned to know how to program apps, but teaching math the last couple of years has, quite literally, taking over my life. Now that I have already committed myself to making a career change (I’m not going back to teaching this year because I want to 100% focus on my career transition), and because of how my brain is naturally “wired,” and if I had the key-knowledge from Ada’s amazing program, then I really envision myself working on a team to build something that could truly make a difference. Whether that difference is a website, an app, or some sort of program behind the scenes that I don’t even know how to describe… All I know is that I see myself learning how to program, working on a team that feels like my family, and doing something I am truly passionate about.

## **Question #3: *After reading [Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement], how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?***     
I truly believe that differences are amazing. Differences are what make us unique and who we are. We need to celebrate difference and embrace it with open arms – not cast it away just because we’re not used to it.  
  
I am accepting and loving of everyone and I will (and have) always stand by that – I am a stubborn Italian from New York – I do not back down easily. But stubbornness can be a great quality (yet, it has such a negative connotation) – I call myself “stubborn” as quality that I’m proud of. Here’s a story as to why:  
  
Years ago (probably a decade ago now), I had two friends (still friends to this day), who I did not know were gay. We were hanging out and one friend called the other friend a derogatory name (in jest) and they both laughed – I didn’t laugh. My one friend said something along the lines of “well he is, look how he acts, just call him a \_\_\_\_\_, it’s funny, he doesn’t care.” I refused and ended up having an argument with my friend about why he should not use language like that. His argument was “it’s just funny, who cares, there’s no gay people around anyway.” I stood my ground and my beliefs.  I ended up leaving and told them if that’s how they truly think, then perhaps we just simply shouldn’t hang out – I don’t want to be around people who are negative, make jokes at other people’s expense that are only “funny” to other disrespectful people, and who destroy the safe space I build around myself…  
  
A few days later, they came out to me and told me they were both gay (together) – that they weren’t just roommates, but an actual couple.  I thought they were joking at first – another “joke.” They were 100% serious and they said it was amazing how I stood up TO them, FOR them (and without even knowing).  They told me how they had done that to other friends before and other people just casually, uncomfortably, laugh along, but no one has the audacity to actually take a stand. To this day, they praise me for how I was the only one who fought for what I truly believed in, even when I thought no one listening.  
 
So, long story short, how I’ll “contribute” to the Ada community of diversity and inclusivity, is by the same way I “contribute” the diversity and inclusivity already, outside of Ada, in my everyday life: by being accepting and loving of everyone, letting no one destroy the safe environment I build around myself, and by being my normal “stubborn” self when it comes to taking a stand.

## **Question #4: *Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?***  
I make mistakes all the time and, actually, I’m ok with that because I’ve come to realize that with every mistake, comes a lesson; whether monumental or minute, each lesson is of value.  
  
One thing that I regret from my life is from when I was a kid and I told my parents that I wanted to quit piano lessons. Although I loved the piano, I wound up quitting because I wanted to play with my friends outside instead of being inside at the piano. At the time, I thought this was a great decision because I was then having fun with my friends seven days per week instead of my six days per week (how a kid would think, right?).  
  
Later in life, I’ve come to really regret this decision. “Was that extra day of friend-time really worth it in the end? It was just one measly day out of the week! Moreover, I’m not even friends with them anymore!” This was my conclusion after years of reflection on the matter (around teenage-years and in college).  
  
From that point-of-reflection on, I really learned from my “mistake” of quitting the piano; although I was sad that I quit, I now always end up thinking of that situation whenever things get difficult in life. I think about how I am NOT a quitter – I finish what I start, and finish it with flying colors! If I can’t figure out how to do something, then I research, I ask friends, I watch YouTube videos, I bounce ideas off people, or I ask my parents and other family members to get a completely different perspective of things; I might take little breaks here and there to “reboot” my brain, but I always stick to what I start.  
  
Because of this determination and unwavering dedication, that is so deeply rooted into my character, to everything I throw myself into, I’m grateful for the lesson I have learned from my “mistake” when I was only in second grade. I’m not saying that I’m grateful I quit (not at all), but my self-reflection and great character that emerged from the whole situation has been a life-changing pivot-point, for sure!
