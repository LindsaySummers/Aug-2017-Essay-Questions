## **Question #1: Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**  
>    
>Honestly, I have always been interested in programming. Ever since I was young, I was always interested in Legos, robots, science, etc. The closest to “programming” when I was in school was, simply, mathematics, and I have always really loved math. I majored in math in college and then found that I was naturally really good at working with Excel. For fun, I write mini Excel programs which generate customizable math worksheets (for example), which I used to use all the time when I was teaching mathematics.

>Lately, I’ve been really trying to get more and more into programming, so instead of teaching math this year, I am currently teaching “Computational Thinking.” The administrators who hired me, told me that they were specifically looking for a math teacher (a math background is good for the type of thinking, and an experienced teacher in order to deal with students) to learn how to code with the students (and that it was great that I didn’t know much about coding prior to accepting the job). My students and I have worked with spreadsheet basics, [Code.org], [Scratch], and now we’re moving on to web design using [Wix.com].

## **Question #2: If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**  
  
It’s a bit difficult for me to predict where I see myself in 5 years if I were accepted into Ada’s program because I honestly know nothing about the programming world. I don’t know where I would begin, how fast I would progress, or what the possibilities are to even shoot for. What I DO know is that I am an extremely hard worker, I love learning new things, I strive on challenges, and I am hard-wired (as well as trained mathematically) to think logically. Whenever I think of the endless possibilities that I would gain from Ada, I become giddy and day-dream like a little kid! I don’t know what a job as a coder would look like, but I know that I’m excited to find out!

* **Question #3: After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program**   
  
      Inclusivity within a diverse community is honestly where I feel the most comfortable.  I have traveled all over the world, purposely immersing myself into foreign cultures because I feel like I learn the most from people who have (a) different background/experiences/outlook than I do.  Moreover, I am from New York and have always taught in very diverse schools. Accepting, loving, and providing an inclusive education for absolutely everyone is the only path I know in education.  
  
      I would contribute to Ada’s vision by continuing to support these values that I hold so dearly. Also, I love helping and teaching people new things; if I were to grasp the programming concepts that are taught in class, I would love to help and teach others (hence why I went into education in the first place)!

* **Question #4: Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**  
  
      I make mistakes every day – everyone does. Anyone who says otherwise, is either lying, or a fool. I make simple mistakes such as taking the wrong exit driving to work or falling when I try something new while snowboarding, all the time and, I’d like to think, that I always learn from those mistakes.  
  
      Probably the “biggest” mistakes that I make are while teaching my middle school students. Education is an art and it changes all the time, and even on the fly – teachers need to be instantly adaptive. Sometimes, I go into a lesson thinking it’s going to be amazing, and for whatever reason, it doesn’t work out as planned. That’s ok because those “mistakes” aren’t really mistakes, but just small lessons and informal data for my next attempt.  
  
      When I write Excel programs for teaching resources, I make mistakes all the time, but this is how I learn! I write a function that I think will work and then I look at the outcome and if it’s a bit off, I go back and tweak my original line of code. I then learn from this and know next time to try sometime different. Also, every teaching resource that I made is different and calls for something new - this is what I like! I really love learning new things and learning how they work and react together, and then later, applying the things that I’ve learned in new ways (perhaps nested together, or in a different order).
